	abstract = {Taking advantage of the appropriateness of computational analysis for complex patterns, this essay considers how computational humanities methods can move beyond semantic meaning and the written word to address oral forms of performance and aural forms of recognition of South Asian poetry. The essay focuses on two significant figures in the history of modern “Urdu-Hindi” poetry, the contemporary poet Fahmida Riaz and the pre-Partition poet Miraji. Through computational metrical detection and visualization, it considers how poetic meter operates in their work and addresses their audiences in creative ways in their varied milieus. Through a contextualized elaboration of these literary figures’ work, as well as a modeling of their poetic forms, these methods expose the way that sound and rhythm carries meaning in their poetry.},

	abstract = {At the heart of the Digital Humanities discourse in postcolonial information societies like India is a subject that is marked by connectivity and access. The discourse and practice put forward a very explicit imagination of a connected subject that is also naturalized in digital humanities. The intended beneficiary is posited as “to be connected,” entering a curative cycle of literacy and access intended to reform this subject. This paper proposes a subject of “disconnectivity,” which needs to be introduced into this debate. In the face of Internet blackouts and online bans, there is a subject who gets disconnected when it has potential for dissent or critique. Drawing from 1000 responses gathered in the wake of a political agitation in the city of Ahmedabad, I sketch the new paradoxes of the disconnected subject. It offers a critique of the tropes of access, presence, inclusion, and participation to show how digital humanities in South Asia needs a more critical investment in imagining its subjects as it takes on the politics of preservation, memory, and archiving.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the possibility for the galleries, libraries, archives and museums sector to employ playful, immersive discovery interfaces for their collections and raise awareness of some of the considerations that go into the decision to use such technology and the creation of the interfaces.Design/methodology/approach This is a case study approach using the methodology of research through design. The paper introduces two examples of immersive interfaces to archival data created by the authors, using these as a springboard for discussing the different kinds of embodied experiences that users have with different kinds of immersion, for example, the exploration of the archive on a flat screen, a data “cave” or arena, or virtual reality.Findings The role of such interfaces in communicating with the audience of an archive is considered, for example, in allowing users to detect structure in data, particularly in understanding the role of geographic or other spatial elements in a collection, and in shifting the locus of knowledge production from individual to community. It is argued that these different experiences draw on different metaphors in terms of users’ prior experience with more well-known technologies, for example, “a performance” vs “a tool” vs “a background to a conversation”.Originality/value The two example interfaces discussed here are original creations by the authors of this paper. They are the first uses of mixed reality for interfacing with the archives in question. One is the first mixed reality interface to an audio archive. The discussion has implications for the future of interfaces to galleries, archives, libraries and museums more generally.},

	abstract = {The digital cultural record has a powerful role to play in both new and future strategies of creating new homes within the digital milieu. For example, the development and establishment of new digital archives around South Asian studies not only allows us to create new archives of the past but also to remember and commemorate the past differently. New maps transform how we understand space and place. And new digital comfort zones facilitate connections for those whose family and loved ones are only accessible online. Such interventions are essential to the recuperation of the integrity and soul of a people who have lived through and continue to shoulder the fraught and painful legacies of the British Empire and the communal bloodshed wrought by its demise.  Building on the important history of digital humanities scholarship in South Asia and its diasporas that precedes this work, this book contends that South Asian studies is further positioned to offer a new genealogy of digital humanities, demonstrated through this assemblage of essays that reveal how the digital continues to shape notions of home, belonging, nation, identity, memory, and diaspora through a variety of humanistic methodologies and digital techniques.  South Asian Digital Humanities thus demonstrates that postcolonial digital humanities has great possibility for creating some of the most important social justice scholarship in South Asian studies of the past century. It offers these essays as innovative interventions that complicate the digital cultural record while lodging a 'homelanding' for South Asians within it, while positioning digital humanities as a method through which South Asian studies can strategically participate in the ongoing struggle for representation within digital knowledge production. This book was originally published as a special issue of South Asian Review.},

For much of the 20th century, computational scholars had focussed on details, compiling exhaustive concordances of classic texts, densely tagged databases of stylistic examples, or comprehensive digital editions of famous writers. But in the 2000s, scholars acquired a new aspiration: to data mine the archive, and model world literature as a whole. In this chapter, I look back on these 20 years of effort, and take stock. What does it mean to “model” world literature? And how is such modelling affected by digital technology? I contrast three models of world literature: the canon, the cosmopolis, and the archive. In each case, I show how the particular model implies a certain research method, and then consider how that method may be assisted or transformed by digital technology. To conclude, I consider Kath Bode and Roopika Risam’s powerful materialist critiques of digital literary scholarship, and suggest that scholars should embrace orthogonality as the underlying principle of world literary history.},

The textual corpus of Tagore, the first Asian Nobel laureate (1913), includes poems, songs, short stories, novels, essays, travelogues, plays, and more, both in Bengali and in English. Being obsessively critical of his own work, he revised and edited them multiple times over the years. Reading closely through the versions, one can trace not only his complex creative process but also a glimpse of the changing socio-political landscape of a country through the 19th and early 20th centuries and the author’s intellectual response to it. Bichitra provides 140,000 pages of primary material both as images and as transcriptions, a hyperbibliography, a search engine and hyperconcordance tool, and a three-level collation result of the various versions of the titles using a unique collation software developed for the project. The chapter discusses the usability and effectiveness of these tools for the specific purpose of the site and in the domain of computational text analysis in general, and explains the backend structures and efforts that were involved in creating them.},

Drawing on the linguistic, cultural, historical, social, and geographic diversity of Indian texts and contexts, it foregrounds the use of digital technologies — including minimal computing, novel digital humanities research and teaching methodologies, critical archive generation and maintenance — for explicating poetics of Indian literatures and generating scholarly digital resources which will facilitate comparative readings.
With contributions from DH scholars and practitioners from across India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and more, this book will be a key intervention for scholars and researchers of literature and literary theory, DH, media studies, and South Asian Studies.},

	abstract = {The Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC) has been digitising recordings of traditional cultural expression, oral tradition, and music (TCE) for 17 years. A major motivation for this work is the return of these recordings to where they were made. On the one hand there is social justice in preserving records of languages that are under-represented in the internet and cultural institutions, and making them accessible in what can be characterised as a postcolonial restitution of these records. On the other hand, if it is first world academics doing this work, it risks being yet another colonial appropriation of Indigenous knowledge. In this paper I explore some of these issues to help set directions both for our own work, and for future similar projects.

“From ancient times to the present, disquieting use has been made of archival records to establish, document, and perpetuate the influence of power elites.” (Jimerson, 2007: 254). 

A quarter of the world’s languages are found in the Pacific. In communities sustained over many hundreds of years by local economies, the globalised world impinges through urbanisation and encroaching metropolitan languages, particularly in media, accelerating language change and language shift. Technology, in the form of computers, digital files, and ways of working with them, is a first world product, access to it is costly, and the interface to it is never in a local language but always in a major metropolitan language. Training and experience in using technology is not easily obtained, leading to a divide between those who are able to use it and those who are consumers of it, typically via expensive internet connections. How can a new kind of archival enterprise “establish, document, and perpetuate” the languages and their speakers, in order to counter what Jimerson calls the influence of power elites.},

The chapter seeks to answer a crucial question: what does a Hindu-Urdu audiobook mean for the two languages that have been touted as distinct from each other? Hindi and Urdu share the same grammatical structure but are written in different scripts. Since an audio book disregards the script, what does it mean for the two languages? Have Hindi and Urdu diverged to the extent that they have become unintelligible to the speaker and listener of the other language? Does the commonality between them leave any ground for the old ghost of Hindustani to be resurrected? This chapter makes use of reader’s response criticism to trace the history of Hindustani in the popular and oral domain and its continuing legacy in contemporary literature through Hindi-Urdu audiobooks.},

In the absence of digital scholarly corpora, resources developed by citizen scholars working outside of academia are essential; for our team and audience, this includes free and open source solutions — including optical character recognition tools — developed in other contexts. Modeling formal, metrical, thematic, and rhythmic structures opens up the possibility for computer-assisted scholarly analysis across the variously related languages and literary histories of India, which are usually treated in isolation. Positioning our work as a form of minimal computing, we discuss our workflow as a jugaad — a North Indian term for reuse and innovation in the presence of constraints.},

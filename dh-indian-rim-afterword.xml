    <p>Why in “Indian Rim”? When we began DH in the Indian Rim, we had the
utopian desire to construct a new research network in the Global South,
to rival the Transatlantic network that continues to dominate scholarly
life. What could digital humanists in South Asia, Australasia, East
Africa and the Persian Gulf teach one another about digital scholarship?
How does Digital Humanities (DH) look from the Indian Ocean?</p>
    <p>The Indian Ocean does present challenges as a shared space to work.
There are few existing institutional links, and what links there are,
are typically mediated by Atlantic institutions. This was readily
apparent at our first conference, <italic>digital + humanities</italic>,
held online in 2019. At that conference, we successfully attracted
speakers from South Africa, Nigeria, Abu Dhabi, Mauritius, Australia and
India. But our participant from Abu Dhabi worked at a satellite campus
of New York University, our Mauritian colleague worked in an academic
program certified by a French university, and many of our collaborators
from India were either educated or held Faculty positions in Britain or
America. I myself convened the conference from my home office in
England.</p>
    <p>Is it possible—or even desirable—to try and escape the Atlantic? What
have we been able to achieve, working within and across the Indian
Ocean? Does it even make sense to think of the Indian Ocean as a
distinct intellectual <italic>milieu</italic>, when so many scholars
from the region have taken up degrees or faculty positions in countries
outside it?</p>
    <p>Today, India and Australia are well-established players in global DH.
It is no surprise that this book, though it began with higher
aspirations, has resolved into a collaboration between scholars from
these two nations. As these contributions indicate, scholars in India
and Australia are flourishing in the mainstream of DH: they build
databases, remediate archives, analyse text computationally, critique
technology humanisitically, and wonder how to convert DH from a field of
research into a viable teaching program under local conditions. In these
respects, neither Indian nor Australian DH need to make excuses for
themselves.</p>
    <p>This is not enough to justify “DH in the Indian Rim,” however. If
scholars around the Indian Ocean Rim wish to form a distinctive group,
then their group must have some distinctive qualities. What are
they?</p>
    <p>As Cohen and Jana suggest in their introduction, the distinction lies
in our shared histories of colonisation. To be sure, these histories are
not the same. Australia is a settler-colonial state with a white
majority, hundreds of Indigenous peoples and a growing plurality of
global migrants—including some 600,000 from India (Chand, this volume).
India is a large federation of postcolonial states, with an enormous
global diaspora, and its own history of domination by caste, religion,
language and region. On the surface, these histories of colonisation
seem hardly the same, but they have bred in both countries a powerful
hunger for postcolonial—or decolonial—approaches to DH.</p>
    <p>In what follows, I discuss three main strands of postcolonial DH,
indicating how Indian and Australian digital humanists have made unique
and complementary contributions to them. The strands are
<italic>counter-archiving</italic>, <italic>multilingual DH</italic> and
<italic>jugaad</italic>, or <italic>minimal computing</italic>. Like all
strands, these three are intertwined, but I hope to make them
sufficiently clear for discussion. I conclude with a reflection on
possible futures for DH in the Indian Rim. Indigenous scholars are
entering the Australian academy in greater numbers. Indian scholars are
reviving Sanskrit learning, and using it to critique dominant Western
methodologies, with ever greater success. These developments raise the
possibility of a fundamentally new kind of Digital Humanities, with new
origin stories and new directions, liberated from the inspiring but also
stifling myths that have hitherto given DHers their sense of academic
identity (see
<xref alt="Jones 2016" rid="ref-jones_roberto_2016" ref-type="bibr">Jones
2016</xref>).</p>
    <sec id="counter-archiving">
      <title>Counter-archiving</title>
      <p>Cohen presents a splendid example of
  <italic>counter-archiving</italic> in his chapter on the Strehlow
  Research Centre (SRC). In this case, the project ‘counters’
  traditional archives by respecting the cultural authority of its
  subjects. Although much of the research Cohen describes is
  technologically at the cutting-edge, he asserts quite rightly that the
  project’s real innovation lies “in developing protocols and processes
  for digitising culturally sensitive films” (this volume). The SRC is a
  closed, rather than an open archive. It gives Arrernte people control
  over their cultural heritage. As Cohen’s impressive bibliography
  demonstrates, this closedness of the archive has not prevented
  research. Articles and monographs continue to flow. It is quite
  possible that closing the archive may have <italic>opened</italic>
  Arrernte people to research, by giving them confidence that they can
  set the terms. Of course the most important aspect of the project is
  its usefulness to traditional owners, who are drawing on the archive
  to “revitalise ceremonies that haven’t been performed for
  generations.”</p>
      <p>The preeminent theorist of postcolonial DH is Indian-American
  scholar Roopika Risam. In <italic>New Digital Worlds</italic> (2019),
  she prpounds a theory of postcolonial “world-making,” which can
  usefully be applied to Cohen’s project. As Risam sees it, postcolonial
  DH is both critical and practical. On the critical side, postcolonial
  DH scholars “addresses underexplored questions of power,
  globalization, and colonial and neocolonial ideologies that are
  shaping the digital cultural record in its mediated, material form[.]”
  On the practical side, postcolonial DH scholars “[design] new tools,
  methods, and workflows that are based in local practices […] to create
  space for underrepresented communities to populate the digital
  cultural record with their own stories.”
  (<xref alt="Risam 2019, 9" rid="ref-risam_new_2019" ref-type="bibr">Risam
  2019, 9</xref>) Both these sides of postcolonial DH are exemplified in
  Cohen’s project. It began with a critique of the Strehlow Research
  Centre’s settler-colonial heritage, and morphed into a practical
  project to digitise the archive according to Arrernte cultural
  protocols.</p>
      <p>India’s history of colonisation is different to Australia’s, and
  accordingly the critical side of counter-archiving is different. The
  practical side, however, is often similar. Consider the reflections by
  C.S. Lakshmi, long-time curator of the SPARROW archive in Mumbai. She
  set up the archive to combat dominant narratives about the “Third
  World,” which is “supposed to worry about slums, environment, legal
  aid for women, health care, rural development and so on” (quoted in
  <xref alt="Kalra and Nene 2020, 142" rid="ref-dodd_ethics_2020" ref-type="bibr">Kalra
  and Nene 2020, 142</xref>). Her archive allows women to tell the
  stories they wish to tell about themselves, rather than fit into a
  global developmental narrative. On the critical side, therefore, this
  project is quite distinct from Cohen’s: Cohen critiques a
  settler-colonial archive in the possession of a white ruling class,
  and helps to return the archive to its traditional owners. Lakshmi
  sets up a new archive to tell stories that are missing from existing
  archives about the “Third World.” On the practical side, however,
  Lakshmi’s project converges with Cohen’s:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>What happens is the demand for fully open archiving comes from
    the West. I’m not for fully-open archiving. I’ll tell you why. For
    example, let me say I have interviewed an Indian woman worker who
    tells me all about her life: her personal life, her sexual life,
    everything. It’s available with the archives. We have also digitized
    it in a way that people can read it on their computer; it’s
    possible. I can give excerpts of it, for example, but we can’t make
    the whole thing available online because I feel that when you put it
    on the web, millions of people can read it for no purpose. (quoted
    in
    <xref alt="Kalra and Nene 2020, 143" rid="ref-dodd_ethics_2020" ref-type="bibr">Kalra
    and Nene 2020, 143</xref>)</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Like Cohen, Lakshmi has developed protocols that rub against the
  dominant digital ideology of “openness” or the “free flow of
  information” (see
  <xref alt="Tkacz 2015, chap. 1" rid="ref-tkacz_wikipedia_2015" ref-type="bibr">Tkacz
  2015, chap. 1</xref>). In this case, Lakshmi has developed protocols
  informally over many decades with her informants, devising a locally
  appropriate division between revelation and concealment (she rejects
  the public/private distinction:
  <xref alt="Kalra and Nene 2020, 150" rid="ref-dodd_ethics_2020" ref-type="bibr">Kalra
  and Nene 2020, 150</xref>). Lakshmi is typical. Surveying the scene of
  Indian DH, Shah
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-shah_digital_2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  argues that India has entered a “post-access” phase of
  digitisation.</p>
      <p>In Australia, counter-archiving is increasingly well organised,
  overseen by Indigenous scholars and archivists. Kukutai and Taylor
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-kukutai_indigenous_2016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  have edited a seminal collection on <italic>Indigenous Data
  Sovereignty</italic>, with contributors from Australia, Aoteoroa/New
  Zealand and North America. Organisations such as the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Indigenous Data
  Network</ext-link> and the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Indigenous Archives
  Network</ext-link> provide platforms for Indigenous scholars and
  archivists to critique existing archives and organise to build new
  ones. The Commons
  (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-australian_research_data_commons_care_2022" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
  has subsequently adopted the CARE principles as core guidelines,
  alongside the more familiar FAIR
  principles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> Major DH archives
  such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">People
  Australia</ext-link>,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Austlit/Blackwords</ext-link>,
  and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Trove</ext-link> have,
  with varying degrees of success, either brought in Indigenous managers
  or adopted more culturally sensitive practices. Indigenous scholars
  are increasingly prominent in public debates about knowledge
  institutions. In the last two years, Thorpe, Sentance, and Booker
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-thorpe_wikimedia_2023" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
  and <bold>FIRST NATIONS FOCUS GROUP</bold> have released highly
  publicised reports full of stark but constructive criticism about the
  world’s pre-eminent knowledge institution: Wikipedia. Although many
  Australian researchers (the author included) continue to work in the
  traditional digital fields of text analysis and cultural databasing,
  it seems that Australia is entering its own “post-access” phase of
  DH.</p>

      <title>Multilingual DH</title>
      <p>India and Australia are profoundly multilingual, as are most
  countries in the Indian Rim. India is <bold>GET STATS</bold>.
  Australia is home to more than 200 Indigenous languages, and hundreds
  more community languages, although the hegemony of English renders
  many minority languages vulnerable <bold>CHECK STATS</bold>. In this
  respect, DH in the Indian Rim again contrasts with its Atlantic
  counterpart. Although of course there are many Indigenous languages in
  North America, and several European nations with more than one
  official language, DH in the Atlantic has seldom had to grapple with
  the same degree of multilingualism as DH in the Indian Rim.</p>
      <p>In India, multilingualism is essentially compulsory. It is not
  possible to research digital artefacts or platforms without
  encountering multple languages. This is illustrated beautifully in
  Chand’s chapter. Chand is doubly diasporic: a member of Fiji’s Indian
  minority, who subsequently migrated to Australia. Her research into
  dating apps reveals a network of languages linking members of the
  Indian diaspora across cities and oceans. Some languages are supported
  on some platforms, and some on others. She must rely on her own
  multilingual proficiency in order to examine and understand the
  platforms. Compulsory multilingualism is also a feature of Nayak and
  Rana’s research. Even though they use an English translation of the
  text, they must be constantly mindful of the underlying Sanskrit.
  Sometimes a Sanskrit word surfaces in the English translation
  (e.g. <italic>stridhana</italic>). At other times, the translation
  requires careful interpretation (e.g. when the word “class” is used in
  the meaning of “caste”). English has not been in contact with Sanskrit
  as long as it has been in contact with Latin or Greek. The Indian
  scholar writing in English must always be aware of a gap between the
  text under study and the academic text they are writing. Thus in this
  case, too, multilingualism is <italic>compulsory</italic>, where in
  the Atlantic world it is often avoidable.</p>
      <p>Indian DH projects are almost inevitably multilingual. The Asian
  Art Archive’s Bibliography of Modern and Contemporary Art Writing of
  South Asia records more than 12,000 pieces of art writing in 12
  languages
  (<xref alt="Ragavan 2020" rid="ref-ragavan_processes_2020" ref-type="bibr">Ragavan
  2020</xref>). <bold>Other examples</bold></p>
      <p>Despite the hegemony of English, DH in Australia has been unusually
  multilingual for a long time. This is probably due to the relative
  prominence of field linguists, archaeologists and anthropologists in
  Australian DH. The flagship project for multilingual DH in Australia
  is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">PARADISEC</ext-link>, a
  large digital archive that aims to conserve the cultural and
  linguistic heritage of the Australia-Pacific. It is a venerable
  project, now in its <bold>25th</bold> year. It contains recordings,
  videos and written materials in <bold>INSERT NUMBER</bold> languages
  from across Australia and the Pacific. As I discuss in the next
  section, PARADISEC has taken special measures to make its materials
  available to the communities it represents, and has control measures
  in place to allow them to protect their cultural data. Other
  Australian projects in a similar vein include:
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Austlang</ext-link>, which
  provides metadata abotu Indigenous Australian Languages; the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">Living Languages
  Platform</ext-link>, which provides free dictionary apps of Indigenous
  Australian languages; and the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="">AUSLAN
  Signbank</ext-link>, an innovative video dictionary of Australian Sign
  Language.</p>
      <p>These classic Australian examples of multilingual DH have mostly
  been aimed at specialist researchers and the communities they study.
  More recently, innovative DH researchers have found ways to reach a
  wider audience. As part of the <italic>Waves of Words</italic> project
  (mentioned in Burrows, this volume), Hendery and Burrell
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-hendery_playful_2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  developed <italic>Glossopticon</italic>, a virtual reality experience
  in which users could explore the linguistic diversity of the Pacific
  with all the senses. Users could fly across the Pacific, following
  known canoe routes, and hear recorded speech from PARADISEC on the
  islands. In a different strand of the project, Antoinette Schaepper
  and I experimented with machine learning, concept mapping and string
  matching to hunt for shared vocabulary in Australian, Papuan and
  Polynesian languages. It has hitherto been difficult to incorporate
  multiple languages in the traditiona DH fields of text analysis and
  cultural analytics. But Indian and Australian DHers are steadily
  making the effort.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="jugaad-or-minimal-computing">
      <title><italic>Jugaad</italic>; or minimal computing</title>
      <p>One of the most important aspects of postcolonial DH is
  <italic>jugaad</italic>, or minimal computing. As the Hindi name for
  the practice suggests, minimal computing has been a key theme in
  Indian DH, where internet and computer penetration is far lower than
  in the Atlantic strongholds of traditional DH. <italic>Jugaad</italic>
  is an untranslatable word that intersects with the English “makeshift”
  or “hacking.” As Ray Murray and Hand
  (<xref alt="2015, 144" rid="ref-ray_murray_making_2015" ref-type="bibr">2015,
  144</xref>) observe in their canonical treatment of the topic,
  <italic>jugaad</italic> resembles other practices of “technological
  disobedience” in the Global South, including
  “<italic>Gambiarra</italic> in Brazil, <italic>Rebusque</italic> in
  Colombia, and <italic>Jua Kali</italic> in Kenya.” The concept is
  tricky, as Mukherjee
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-mukherjee_digital_2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
  points out. If <italic>jugaad</italic> is an inherently disobedient
  practice, how can it be incorporated into the disciplined structures
  of an academic degree? Ray Murray
  (<xref alt="2020, 130" rid="ref-ray_murray_decolonising_2020" ref-type="bibr">2020,
  130</xref>) herself is more sanguine, observing an interesting fact
  about DH pedegogy in India: India’s first graduate DH degree was not
  founded in an English or History department, as is usually the case,
  but was founded in a school of Design. In India, it seems, DH lays a
  stronger emphasis on <italic>making things work</italic> rather than
  <italic>analysing the cultural record</italic>.</p>
      <p>The same cannot be said for Australia. To my knowledge, only four
  Australian Universities have offered teaching programs in DH: Monash
  University, the Australian National University, Western Sydney
  University and Melbourne University. In no case was the program
  offered as part of a degree in Design. Literature, linguistics,
  history and information science have been the dominant disciplines, as
  far as DH pedagogy is concerned.</p>
      <p>But there has been a role for minimal computing and critical making
  in Australian DH. The most poetic example again comes from PARADISEC.
  PARADISEC itself, like many decades-old Humanities databases, is
  optimised for use on a desktop connected to broadband internet.
  Desktops with broadband connections are relatively rare in the steamy
  villages of Vanuatu or the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Desktops are
  likewise less common than they ought to be in remote Aboriginal
  communities in Australia. Accordingly the project has developed
  technology to make linguistic materials available on smartphones using
  a local WiFi network projected from a Raspberry Pi. Linguistic and
  cultural data can be loaded onto the computer, which is robust and
  draws little power. The computer generates a local network, and
  members of the community can access the database.
  <bold>REFERENCE</bold></p>
      <p>In my own work, co-ordinating the Digital Studies program at the
  University of Melbourne, I have taken inspiration from
  <italic>jugaad</italic>. To teach my first-year students how to make
  computers do things, I have them play <italic>Turing Tumble</italic>,
  an AUD$100 mechanical computer. I have them create games using
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://make.bitsy.org">bitsy</ext-link>,
  a web-based “8-bit” game development program. I have them submit their
  assignments in the <italic>PechaKucha</italic> format, a highly
  constrained kind of slideshow. Of course, at the University of
  Melbourne, such constraints are artificial. We are a wealthy
  institution where—despite the usual grumbles—resources are plentiful,
  and our (mostly) privileged students are (mostly) able to obtain what
  they need. But the inspiring examples of my Indian colleauges—and
  other practitioners in the Global South—have demonstrated the value of
  constaint, if we want our students to make things
  <italic>critically</italic>.</p>

      <p>DH in the Indian Rim is an incipient community. Ambassadors of
  Indian DH, such as Rahul Gairola and Asha Chand, have brought their
  knowledge to Australia. Others, such as Ujjwal Jana, Maya Dodd,
  Dibyaduti Roy and Nirmala Menon, have invited Australian collaborators
  into their circles. Building the rest of the network, across the rest
  of the Ocean, will take time and effort, but I am convinced that both
  are worthwhile.</p>
